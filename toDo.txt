// ================ BASIC STRUCTURE ================

SUPERCLASSES: Simulation, Person, Virus

>> SIMULATION:
    >>> Total Population
    >>> Infected Sample of Population
    >>> Vaccinated Sample of Population
    >>> Deceased Sample of Population

>> PERSON:
    >>> Are they un/vaccinated?
    >>> Are they dead or alive?
    >>> Are they sick or healthy?

>> VIRUS:
    >>> Rate of Infectious Spread
    >>> Rate of Mortality


// ======================= v0 =========================

>> Write script to generate population size of random subjects
    >>> Modulate portion of total population who are UNINFECTED
    >>> Modulate portion of total population who are VACCINATED
    >>> Modulate portion of total population who are INFECTED
    >>> Modulate portion of total population who are DEAD

>> Write method to introduce single infectious virus to target population
    >>> Limit number of unique viruses to a single virus with unique properties 

// ======================= v1 =========================

>> Create text file with viruses
    >>> Include varying viruses with different degrees of properties
    >>> Read text doc and use dictionaries/lists to call doc info into main file

// ================ STRETCH CHALLENGES ================

>> Add SUBCLASSES for different virus types
    >>> Vary rate of infectious spread
        >>>> Hard-code information OR use API
    >>> Vary rate of mortality
        >>>> Hard-code information OR use API
    >>> Add immunization rates for specific viruses

>> VISUALIZE data
    >>> Use dynamic spread
    >>> Give options for easy manipulation of input data
