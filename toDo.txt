// ================ BASIC STRUCTURE ================

SUPERCLASSES: Simulation, Person, Virus

>> SIMULATION:
    >>> Total Population
    >>> Infected Sample of Population
    >>> Vaccinated Sample of Population
    >>> Deceased Sample of Population

>> PERSON:
    >>> Are they un/vaccinated?
    >>> Are they dead or alive?
    >>> Are they sick or healthy?

>> VIRUS:
    >>> Rate of Infectious Spread
    >>> Rate of Mortality


// ================ STRETCH CHALLENGES ================

>> Add SUBCLASSES for different virus types
    >>> Vary rate of infectious spread
        >>>> Hard-code information OR use API
    >>> Vary rate of mortality
        >>>> Hard-code information OR use API
    >>> Add immunization rates for specific viruses

>> VISUALIZE data
    >>> Use dynamic spread
    >>> Give options for easy manipulation of input data
