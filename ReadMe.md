# infectorSimulation

# In this project for the Make School Product College course Computer Science 1, I am tasked with developing an interactive and data-visual representation of a stochastic and dynamic simulation by which a target population of humans can be primed and infected with sample viruses and diseases of the user's choice. Each disease and virus has distinct properties by which treated, untreated, vaccinated, unvaccinated, immune, and normal subjects uniquely react. This data is then displayed visually for the user to manipulate.
